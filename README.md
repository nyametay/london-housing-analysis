# 🏠 London Housing Data Analysis with Python

This project involves analysis of the **London Housing Dataset**, which provides valuable insights into the housing market from 1995 to 2019. The dataset includes:

- 📈 Monthly average house prices  
- 🏘 Yearly number of houses sold  
- 🚨 Monthly number of crimes committed  

The data is obtained from Kaggle and processed using **Pandas**.

## 📊 Project Overview

This project demonstrates how to perform practical data analysis on real-world housing data using Python. By working with the London Housing Dataset, we explore key trends in property prices and crime rates over time. The notebook includes data cleaning, feature engineering, and query-based insights to answer specific business-related questions.

### Tasks Performed:

- 🗓 Converting and formatting date fields
- 📅 Extracting time-based features (year, month)
- 🧹 Remove redundant columns
- 🔍 Filtering and querying records for specific conditions
- 🔍 Identify records with `No. of Crimes` = 0
- 💹 Find maximum & minimum `average_price` per year in England
- 📌 Determine max/min number of crimes per area
- 📉 Count of records per area where average price < £100,000
- Identifying trends in pricing and crime distribution
